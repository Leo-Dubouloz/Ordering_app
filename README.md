the user can choose between 3 options: pizza, hamburger, or beer. As soon as there is an addition, the "your order" part is displayed with the items in the list. You can add or remove as many items as you want. The price is of course calculated as you add/delete items.

When the user decides to pay, a form is displayed asking for the user's information. 

When the user has filled in all the information and presses pay, a thank you message is displayed with a list reset.
